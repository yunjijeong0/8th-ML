more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\nSome of the voices are annoying .\\n My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\nThe text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\nI wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\nFirst I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\nSome of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\nThe voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\nThe most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n The voices seem too robotic .\\n However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\nThe voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\nThe default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\nThe voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\nNot only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\nI agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\nThe unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\nThe screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\nUnder the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\nThe voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\nI rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\nThe voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\nVOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\nOthers have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\nThe voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\\n\",\n          \" Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .\\n The service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .\\n Also, thanks to Ken the concierge for recommending Grand Limo service .\\n The restaurant is not cheap but is very well patronised and the service is very good as is the food .\\n Service was spotty  Front desk was marginally helpful .\\n This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .\\nPhenominal Service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .\\n It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us .\\n The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .\\n A highlight of our visit was the historic boats at the Hyde Street Pier , ,  a national Park Service site that costs only $5 .\\n The service was quick and gracious checking in and out .\\nGreat location service and value !\\nSo to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague\\nI did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them .\\nGreat value and service for the price !\\nExcellent Service ,  Great Location\\n The staff and service were exceptional .\\nThe concierge can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants, although we tried Neptune's which was recommended to us and felt it was overpriced for the service and quality .\\n I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .\\nIn addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation .\\nAs I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .\\n All employee's that I mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .\\nWe had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .\\nThe rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .\\nWonderful service friendly people\\nseems service just isn't the way it used to be .\\ni'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .\\nWe have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .\\n The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .\\n All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n Never experienced the room service .\\n Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\nExcellent service great location good value\\nThe staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n The food and service were both excellent .\\n This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n We were very impressed with the service we received .\\nThe concierge service is second to none .\\nTuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\nWe found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\nThe hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\nThe service in the hotel was really good .\\n The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel,

more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\nSome of the voices are annoying .\\n My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\nThe text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\nI wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\nFirst I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\nSome of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\nThe voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\nThe most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n The voices seem too robotic .\\n However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\nThe voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\nThe default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\nThe voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\nNot only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\nI agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\nThe unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\nThe screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\nUnder the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\nThe voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\nI rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\nThe voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\nVOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\nOthers have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\nThe voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\\n\",\n          \" Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .\\n The service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .\\n Also, thanks to Ken the concierge for recommending Grand Limo service .\\n The restaurant is not cheap but is very well patronised and the service is very good as is the food .\\n Service was spotty  Front desk was marginally helpful .\\n This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .\\nPhenominal Service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .\\n It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us .\\n The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .\\n A highlight of our visit was the historic boats at the Hyde Street Pier , ,  a national Park Service site that costs only $5 .\\n The service was quick and gracious checking in and out .\\nGreat location service and value !\\nSo to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague\\nI did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them .\\nGreat value and service for the price !\\nExcellent Service ,  Great Location\\n The staff and service were exceptional .\\nThe concierge can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants, although we tried Neptune's which was recommended to us and felt it was overpriced for the service and quality .\\n I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .\\nIn addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation .\\nAs I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .\\n All employee's that I mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .\\nWe had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .\\nThe rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .\\nWonderful service friendly people\\nseems service just isn't the way it used to be .\\ni'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .\\nWe have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .\\n The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .\\n All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n Never experienced the room service .\\n Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\nExcellent service great location good value\\nThe staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n The food and service were both excellent .\\n This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n We were very impressed with the service we received .\\nThe concierge service is second to none .\\nTuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\nWe found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\nThe hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\nThe service in the hotel was really good .\\n The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n Maid service was prompt and outstanding .\\nvery good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .\\n The customer service was wonderful .\\n The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .\\n, provide service like high end hotels .\\nWill store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,Oldest Italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc .\\n Split a fare w a private service i .\\n, we walked everywhere including up the hill to Coit Tower   then walked down just in time to attend 1300 service @ St .\\n The staff was so friendly and helpful and the concierge service was very knowledgeable .\\n A masseur was giving guests a massage at the same location, not sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\nThe hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .\\nHousekeeping service was very inadequate, though .\\nand the service was just ok too .\\n The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .\\n They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .\\nThe valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\nservice was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .\\n The service was fine with the exception of check, in .\\n From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .\\n Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .\\nNice place but service could be better\\n Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .\\n When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .\\n Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .\\n Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .\\nGreat service and friendly Front Desk .\\n The Concierge service is excellent .\\n Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n This hotel is truly a value for the mid, level traveler looking for excellent accomodations and the HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE ANYWHERE !\\n But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .\\n The service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .\\nGreat location service and beer .\\nThe hotel room was average although the service was good .\\nIn accordance with the Tuscan Inn\\u0092s Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings .\\n In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available .\\n Maid service was prompt, too .\\n the service is poor, and for those used to staying in Kimpton hotels .\\nThere is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .\\n It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .\\n The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .\\nRoom service at the hotel is limited :\\n The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !\\n The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .\\n We ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service .\\n While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time .\\n Found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient .\\nI planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and Hotel chain we would receive good service .\\n The service was excellent, the room was terrific, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions of San Francisco .\\nVery clean room, great location, wonderful service and dog friendly .\\n The personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem, it is immediately remedied .\\n WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .\\n We ate breakfast there one day and were appalled at the slow service, rude waitstaff, and overpriced breakfast food .\\n I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .\\n The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .\\n The only complaint I have is the Valet service .\\n The front desk is the worst service I have had in years .\\n And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .\\ngreat rooms fantastic location and great service !\\n i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !\\n The food at the &quot Cafe&quot  is quite &quot hotel, like&quot  but the

bathrooms .\\n The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .\\n Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .\\n The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .\\n Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .\\n The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .\\n The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .\\nThe room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .\\n You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .\\n The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .\\nbathroom spotless and nicely appointed .\\n The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .\\n The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .\\n They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .\\n Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .\\n If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .\\n The bathroom was big and clean as well .\\n Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .\\n The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .\\n It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .\\n The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .\\n The bathroom was an adequate size .\\nFirst, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .\\n Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .\\n Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .\\n The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\nAmenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .\\n The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .\\n Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .\\n Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .\\n large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .\\n However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .\\n There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .\\nThe thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n The bathroom was large and private .\\n The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\nThe Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\nmy only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n The bathroom had several problems .\\n Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\nThe room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n Plenty of room in the bathroom .\\n Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .\\n The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .\\n Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .\\n Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?\\nbathroom a little on the older side .\\n The bathroom needed a face, lift also .\\n The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .\\n The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .\\n\",\n          \" The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .\\n The over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .\\n There are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block .\\nThe neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from  fast food  to up, scale with a wide variety of cuisines , ,  we never had a bad meal .\\nThe food   was wonderful, a selection of sandwiches, salads, cous cous and spicy wedge potato's, fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed .\\nFull English breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed ,  staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time .\\n One local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  Olives  located one block away .\\n,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .\\n I can't see what sets it apart from other 3, star hotels I've stayed in ,  other than the fact it's in London, in a posh area and has good food .\\n We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .\\n There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well, including fast food joints and two small, ish supermarkets .\\n They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n Breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .\\n The breakfast buffet full English breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food .\\nreally nice hotel for buissnessnot much around in terms of shoppin etcfood was ok\\nEverything about this hotel was first class including the food !\\n The nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which I hadn't expected in a large chain hotel .\\n It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .\\n I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\nRoom service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n   You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .\\n95 if you want hot food as well .\\n Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .\\nThere is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby .\\n As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap :\\nThe hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .\\n Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\nThe food is very, very good   and the staff were very friendly .\\n The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .\\n The food is excellent and the service great .\\n The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .\\n If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .\\n I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\nWe ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n When the food arrive   it was the wrong order .\\n I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .\\n While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .\\n Breakfast was OK, great choice, but the cooked food was a bit tepid .\\n The area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose   burger king, kfc and starbucks .\\nAdditionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .\\n00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs .\\n There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .\\n Many hotels I have stayed in the food has been rarely hot .\\n The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .\\n Within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets .\\n I can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby .\\n Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .\\n Also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced .\\nThe food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it .\\n Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .\\nWould not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !\\n Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\nthere are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .\\nThe food in the restaurant is terrible .\\n Both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children .\\n The Glouster Road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc .\\n Its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious !\\n Stunning food, amazing service .\\n We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .\\n If you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in London is expensive when you consider the terrible USD, GPB exchange rate .\\n Many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine .\\n There are coffee and pastry shops around the corner and fast food .\\n There is also a grocery store in a shopping plaza on the corner where you can buy take out food, wine, etc .\\n It was in a fantastic position, one block to the Gloucester Road tube station    there's a supermarket and fast food shops, as well as other shops nearby and opposite the station .\\n But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .\\n Food was OK, service very haphazard .\\n The range of food available would have satirfied anyone, all well cooked and efficiently replenished .\\nI didn't sample any of the food options but there are several outlets just around the hotel .\\nThe huge coffe bar in the lobby is quite nice and offers drinks and food at good prices .\\n The Delhi Brasserie restaurant recommended by the hotel's concierge was a short walk, the food delicious and reasonable .\\n The food was good and the service was very good .\\n Additionally, there are numerous restaurants everywhere ranging from fast food to upscale .\\n There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .\\n The frig doesn\\u0092t keep items cold enough for food safety \\u0096 it\\u0092s merely to slightly chill .\\nThe Waitrose Market sells yummy food .\\nI want close proximity to tube station, starbucks, and food .\\n Food was expensive, but that is true all over London just now .\\n The Waitrose supermarket has many take out food options .\\nAnother reviewer mentioned the smell of food on the 25th floor .\\n Very convenient, but don't stay on that floor as the smell of heating food wafts down the corridor .\\n The best food deal in this area is the local grocery store down the street ,  get your breakfast and lunch here and dine out nightly .\\n One block from the tube, half a block from a nice grocery store for essentials like bottled water, snacks and takeaway prepared food, tissues, etc .\\n Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .\\nThe food in their pub as far as sandwiches etc, was reasonable .\\n Food in Pub is excellent value .\\n All the 4 nights we stayed there we relished the hot Indian food takeout from the WaitRose grocery chain, which is just around the corner .\\n Really good Indian food is just a few blocks away .\\nThere is an Internet cafe, laundramat and Sainsbury grocery store to the left up Cromwell Road and fast food, Banks   and post offices to the right down Cromwell road .\\n It is in a nice neighborhood with fast food, resturants, and shopping with in walking distance .\\n because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .\\n The food was delicious in both the Consortia and Forum restaurants in the hotel .\\n\",\n          \" Great location for tube and we crammed in a fair amount of sightseeing in a short time .\\nAll in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price .\\nGreat Price Terrific Location .\\nThe location is absolutely wonderful .\\nOur main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .\\nVery Good Value ,  Excellent Location .\\n The location is ideal for travel all over the city via the Underground .\\nExcellent hotel in prime location .\\nGood Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .\\nFirst and foremost, the good, yes it has good location, a block away from Gloucester Road Tube Station .\\n The convenient location and competitive rates finally sold us on a repeat visit .\\nThe location of this hotel is it's best feature ,  two blocks from the tube on lines that run to most major attractions .\\nThe saving grace of this hotel, is the friendly staff and its location in Kensington .\\nThe positives were the location, a block from the Gloucster Rd .\\n The public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant' .\\nIts saving grace is its location .\\n The location is excellent ,  near to the Tube and walking distance of a lot of attractions .\\n Turned out to be this excellent property in a prime location .\\n Location could not have been better with the Gloucester Road tube station just a few minutes' walk from the hotel .\\n Bottom line is that I would definitely return to this property for its comfort and convenient location .\\nGreat Location clean good place to stay !\\n Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends, and would probably stay here again, because it was such a great location and clean .\\n Even better is the hotel's location ,  literally a two, minute walk around the corner and you're at the Gloucester Road Tube Station and a host of small shops, pubs and eateries .\\nGreat stay friendly service great location .\\n I would say this is a better than standard HI and the location just can't be beat .\\n I am giving a 'very good' based on staff, rates,and location .\\n We liked the location and decided to stay again .\\n The location close to a tube station and a grocery store is ideal .\\naverage hotel in a good location .\\nThis hotel is in a good location .\\n If you want a reasonably priced place to stay in London in a convenient location, then this is a good choice !\\nExcellent Hotel Excellent location Would definately stay again !\\nIn London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .\\n It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .\\ngreat hotel in a lovely location .\\n Excellent location next to Gloucester Road tube station that has 3 train lines making getting around London really easy .\\nGood location one excellent concierge but problems .\\n The location of the hotel is really good .\\nGreat Location for Sightseeing .\\nEfficient hotel with a good location .\\n The location is a block away from the underground station on the Picadilly Line direct from Heathrow Airport .\\nExcellent Hotel ,  Great Location .\\nGood Location New Room Bad Service  .\\nThe hotel was a great location just 1 block from Tube, Grocery Stores, Pharmacy and 2 blocks from Natural History and Victoria   Albert Museums .\\nConvenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .\\nGreat location but definitely NOT a 4 star hotel .\\nLOCATION ,  this hotel is located around the block from the Gloucester tube station   and a few ATM machines .\\nGreat location but is it really 4 star ?\\n,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .\\n The location was only a five minute walk from the Gloucester Road Tube stop .\\n Great location, near Gloucester Road tube station, handy cluster of cafes, shops, couple of pubs, plus supermarket in the station complex .\\n For the price and location, this was a very great hotel .\\nGood location clean and comfortable .\\nGreat location but not sure it's worth the money .\\n What you are really paying for at this hotel is location and in hotel restaurants .\\n Fantastic location very close to the tube and buses .\\n It was a pretty good value and in a good location .\\n We wanted something more spacious, but this hotel had extremely convenient location and good reviews, so we decided to stay there .\\n The positives, great location, just a few minutes from a tube station which makes touring easy and with a travelcard taking midday breaks is easy .\\nApart from the location, the hotel was really not up to standard .\\n It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .\\nexcellent location friendly staff .\\nwent for a city break with the family hotel good location harrods 20 mins walk,royal albert hall 10 mins,and under ground around the corner,plenty to see and do around hotel .\\n One good aspect of this hotel was the location, it is about 2 blocks to the tube station, shopping and eating .\\n Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc .\\nLocation is not very good since one has to travel by tube to shop or sightsee .\\n The location to the Gloucester Road tube station was very handy .\\n We chose it due to its location i .\\nGreat location for first time traveller .\\n When I approached one stewardess, she assured me that her airline used Holiday Inn Kensington Forum on a regular basis because of its location .\\nHotel was super average nothing great about it at all except the location .\\nSince everyone starts with the good that I agree with ,  great location, very clean, I'll state the not, so good .\\n One of the best features of this hotel is the LOCATION .\\n The hotel's location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping   and the Tube .\\nLocation great but hotel dated .\\nTower block hotel in fantastic location near good shops, bars and restaurants .\\n The positives about the place are the views from the windows if you have an upper floor room, and the location next to Gloucester Road tube station and a small shopping area .\\n For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location\\nNice hotel with great location for transportation .\\nWe've stayed at this hotel before and it's always been a great choice for it's location, cleanliness and staff .\\n very good location, next to underground station, very near to city center .\\nConvenient location Great Concierge service .\\n It isn't the most central location but I found it easy enough to get into London .\\n I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .\\nGreat location and above average rooms .\\n For the price and the location I thought this place was great .\\n The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n Even otherwise, no matter if it's going to cost you a bit more, I'd still recommend it, considering its location and overall standards .\\n There was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location .\\nLocation is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles   .\\nLocation was excellent with close proximity to tube station We will definitely stau here again , good value\\nGreat location for

price, and the favourable location, we were content .\\npleasant hotel very good location .\\nGreat location for all London has too offer .\\n The hotel is in a very good location for touring London .\\nClean rooms, great location, close to the Gloucester Tube entrance .\\n The one standout is location , ,  it's only about a block from the Gloucester Rd tube station, which is on the Picadilly line that connects to Heathrow, so being on the west side of London, it's a shorter ride to and from aiport and a very short walk to your hotel with no changes, and then you are close to public transport for the rest of your stay .\\nGood hotel for the price nice location .\\n No noise problems   and a nice, convenient location .\\nPerfect Location and Excellent Hotel .\\nRoom ,  clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerLocation ,  within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street .\\nGreat location ,  good value

location alone is worth the stay .\\nThe location is fantastic near Gloucester Station which was very handy for all our needs in transport !\\nThe breakfast we had 1 morning was to say the least quite incredible there was so much variety, there was also no complaint in this area with the staff they were right on the ball   helpfulThis hotel while being high rise had some low moments for us as we felt some areas were really lacking but the hotels location is superb and staff like Peter did try and make your stay worth while .\\nThe location is South West London and a healthy but doable walk from landmarks like the Museum of Natural History, Albert's Hall, Kensington Gardens, and Harrods .\\nLOCATIONA block from Gloucester Road Tube which is conveniently on the Piccadilly, District   Circle lines .\\n Other reviewers are right, the entrance is in a bizarre location but once you figure it out, it's fine .\\nNice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but

excellent .\\n Lovely hotel, terrific location, wonderful helpful staff, immaculately clean rooms .\\nGreat location, 1 min from Gloucester Tube .\\nExcellent location good value .\\nExcellent

.\\n I like this hotel due to its location, but the management need to get a grip .\\n Its in an easy location from the tube, just two minutes walk .\\n The hotel has an unbeatable location in a very nice part of South Kensington ,  only 1 block from the Gloucester Road station   .\\n The location of the hotel is fine and actually the hotel is not extremely bad but it is extremely EXPENSIVE .\\nWe've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\nThe hotel itself is truly in a great location ,  on the same road as the major London museums it took a leisurely 5, 10 minutes to stroll to the wonderful Natural History Museum   a further 5, 10 minutes up the road to Harrods .\\n If we hadn't experienced a problem with the a c I would have rated my overall stay here 5 5 for value, location, comfort, etc .\\n Location itself is great, but everything else is terrible .\\n don t stay here unless if the Kensington location is important to you .\\nGeat location, clean, relatively quiet inside the rooms, somewhat confortable .\\n The main reasons are location and the quality of the air conditioning .\\n Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat .\\n   Clean rooms, bustling lobby, GREAT location .\\n I will NOT recommend this location .\\n I travelled during the off, season in January to London, this was my first stay at this location and I would definitely consider doing so again .\\n Less than a five minute walk from the tube station and within walking distance to the Museum of Natural History, really a good location .\\n, ,  The one thing this hotel has it going for it is the location .\\nWith a kid and a stroller, this definitely is a very convenient location .\\n Cromwell is a pretty posh and popular location .\\nA fine hotel and great location .\\n We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .\\nGreat location indifferent service .\\n This being our first ever visit to UK, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from Glousceter Rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, Piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a c of maintainence etc .\\nGood value and excellent location .\\n Booking through Priceline led me to the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum which was inexpensive, in a great location, and clean and comfortable .\\n The location of the hotel is great because

enjoy .\\nNice hotel with great location .\\n The location is excellent, just a half a block from the Glouster Rd .\\n Also, the tour bus most likely will not drop you off at your hotel after the tour, but rather at Victoria Station or some location nearest your hotel as the bus driver can get .\\n Also, the close location of the gloucester road tube stop is great for getting around all of london .\\n Great location ,  a couple of minutes walk from Gloucester Rd underground station, and shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc\\nGreat location but don't bring the car !\\n The location is great however, only 5 mins walk from the Gloucester Road tube and 10 mins walk to the South Kensington museums, Albert Hall, etc .\\n The hotel is in an ok location ,  close the the Gloucester Rd tube station .\\nThe location of the hotel was great .\\n Otherwise, really great location with the refrige being key .\\nThis is our 2nd time at the Kensington Forum and love the location .\\nLocation was great come out of tube station, take first turn right and walk 150 yards   you're there !\\n Location was great ,  close to tube stop .\\nThe location of the hotel was excellent, a 5 min stroll from Gloucester Road tube, next to tesco express and a large supermarket just around the corner .\\n The location is perfect, very central and very near the subway .\\n However the location was great with the underground and good restaurants   nearby .\\nOne of the nicest features about this hotel is the location .\\nSo many employees, a wonderful location, an impressive building .\\nWell, after all, as I said, great location, great view, NOTHING ELSE !\\n On a positive note the location is great and the overworked staff did their best however if visiting London their are definitely better options such as the NH which is just around the corner .\\n Perfect location, right around the corner from the tube .\\n Our parents who are 55, 70 were able to wonder around the entire city by themselves due to the ideal location of this hotel .\\n Nothing fancy but we were quite happy with the location of the hotel, just like most who have stayed at the hotel before .\\n Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then .\\n The breakfasts were excellent and the location is great for viewing London by bus, on foot and by tube  , which is just at the end of the road .\\nGreat Location, Very Clean Miami FL .\\n The location in the Kensington area could not have been better, the area is safe, nice and fairly quiet .\\nA Great Location, Friendly And Polite Staff, First Class Breakfast And Rooms As Described Above Will Have Me Returning Again And Again .\\n Very convenient location for Gloucester Road tube .\\nThe location was excellent with a number of good eating options locally and Garfunkels and Ask Pizza located in a complex within a very short walking distance for kids   who want something easy .\\n brilliant, behind tube station, near local stores, restaurant, posh area, near kensington park, great central location yet quiet enough in a cul, de, sac location .\\n flaw location of main entrance, big signs and big flags on main street but enter from the back, tiny miserable unwelcoming cheap entrance design, confusing to first time visitors .\\nthe only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .\\n The Forum Holiday is a big high rise and right across the street, is another Holiday Inn, albeit it much smaller which tends to confuse people looking for that 2nd location hotel .\\nGreat Location and Hotel for the Money .\\n The location in South Kensington is excellent as the Gloucester Road tube station is just around the corner and is served by 3 main lines, , District, Circle and Piccadilly .\\n Can't say enough about the price, quality, location and convenience of this hotel and area .\\n Good points excellent location really very close to the tube and the tube is on good lines so not lots of changing .\\n The location is in a good location near the tube and only a few minutes by cab to central London   .\\n Although in some ways I would have preferred a smaller, more authentic English hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .\\nLocation is good if you plan on taking the tube .\\nWould recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .\\nDecent rooms and good location .\\nStayed at this hotel, for one night, as the location was ideal for our night out at the Royal Albert Hall   .\\nAs also said before, location is excellent, very near the tube stations, plenty of delis and eating places nearby and a supermarkets for any snacks we wanted for the room .\\n Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .\\ngood location great deal on priceline .\\nThis hotel is in a very convenient location, just a block and a half from the Gloucester Road tube station .\\n Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent .\\nStayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid .\\n The location was great too as it was next to the tube .\\nExcellent location but rooms far too hot

Gloucester Road tube on Piccadilly, Circle and District lines and was therefore an ideal base for our sight seeing visit .\\n Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !\\n Since this location is the designated layover site for American Airlines, there were tons of pilots and flight attendants everywhere, but that added to the  familiar  feeling of having Americans around .\\n

a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again\\n The location is also good because it is literally 150 footsteps   from

value, efficiency and cleanliness .\\n The location and American standards   are nice touches .\\n The location was perfect, just a minute from the Gloucester Rd .\\n We were easily able to navigate the city from this location .\\n The hotel is clean, modern, and in an excellent location .\\n But we would definitely stay again because of the hotel's location .\\n Aside from that, the location is great and the furnishings were modern and very comfortable .\\nExcellent location and service .\\n The location is excellent, just a short walk from the Gloucester Road tube station and in a lovely neighborhood .\\n Overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !\\nLocation is fantastic ,  both on bus line and underground, with many useful stores on Gloucester Rd .\\nThis is a good basic hotel which has a terrific location .\\n,  checked us in at 11 am after a transatlantic flight,  room larger than average, compared to our continental Europe travel,  location, location, location  .\\n The location is right next to the Picadilly line tube stop, so it is very convenient to get around town and also to the airport .\\nGreat location, grocery store open 24 hours within 5 mins walk and friendly international staff, will stay here again .\\nGreat location ,  but executive room not worth it !\\nWe enjoyed our trip to London ,  and the location for the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was terrific .\\nI do recommend the hotel ,  it was clean, excellent location, there was ice on the top floor along with one microwave, etc .\\n Right off of the Piccadilly and Circle tube lines, the location is excellent .\\n It is a relatively new hotel, clean and has a great location which is close to the underground with 3 connecting lines, it gives you an advantage to go anywhere without changing lots of trains .\\n Fantastic location right next to Gloucester Rd tube station .\\nExcellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .\\n All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .\\n Speaking of the tube, the location really is great 1 block away !\\n The location of the hotel

excellent ,  one block from the tube Gloucester Rd and the surrounding neighborhood is fantastic ,  take a walk from High Street Kensington to the hotel ,  I'd love to live there !\\nGreat Hotel Great Location Great Value !\\n The biggest advantage of this hotel is it's excellent location just off of Gloucester Road in Kensington, with the Undergroud one block away, along with several nice restaurants and pubs in the area .\\n Although the location is a bit removed from the West End, it is only a block away from the Gloucester Road underground, with three train lines that will take you almost anywhere in the city in 15 minutes or less .\\ngreat location good but large tourist hotel .\\n The location is great and very convenient .\\nThe location is great but there are many hotels in the same area so I might try out others but would certainly consider coming back .\\nCan't beat the location, rooms, value and view !\\nGood Value Nice Hotel Fantastic Location .\\nHoliday Inn KF has a location that cannot be beat .\\n this is definitely the location you want .\\nGreat location loved the hotel .\\n The tube station is right there and the location is great for getting around London .\\n You could not beat the location or the price .\\n The price is moderate for the service and the location .\\nI will say this hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from the gloucester tube station and only a stop or two away from Notting hill, Harrods, and Kensington High street .\\nLocation is so convienent to the tube and grocery .\\n Other than room size, we were very happy with the hotel, especially its location .\\n Overall good hotel and very good location close to the tube   .\\n The hotel has a great location with easy access to most of London's tourist sites .\\n The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .\\n The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .\\nYes I do stay here a lot and as such, guess that I get extra special treatment but it is in a great location with the tube within a 2 min walk surrounded by places to eat and drink and far enough out of central London to be quiet but you can still be in the west end in 15 minutes .\\nGREAT LOCATION COMFORTABLE HOTEL .\\nOutstanding location, even an internet cafe nearby .\\n the hotel is in a GREAT location .\\n Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .\\n The location couldn't be better in my opinion .\\nPrice and location can't be beat .\\n As said by others, an absolutely excellent location, on tube lines that will get you to just about anywhere .\\n The location could not have been better with being so close to the Underground station and near good restaurants, grocery stores, post office, pharmacy, Internet cafe .\\n The hotel is set in an absolutely ideal location, offers great rates, and excellent conceirge   .\\n Great location, one block from the Gloucester Tube station with a number of acceptable restaurants in the area within walking distance .\\nBest location and unbeatable price !\\nThis is an awesome location right near the Gloucester Road tube stop .\\n Definitely stay here if you are on a budget ,  and even if not, it's still nice and the location is really the best !\\n A true bargain in the London hotel market, and a very convenient location adjacent to the Gloucester road underground station .\\nExcellent location but a couple of problems .\\n The location is excellent being a few minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station with its good connection to Heathrow airport and to central London .\\nGreat choice in a great location .\\n The location could not be better ,  one block from the intersection of Cromwell and Gloucester Roads, with the Glouster Road tube stop .\\n I say  fortunate  because the location was perfect for my needs as a first, timer .\\n This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .\\n The location could not be better and best of all it was so clean .\\n Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location .\\n Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .\\nGreat room fabulous price wonderful location !\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .\\nThe widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\nGarmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the

that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\nTraffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a Garmin, and

all .\\nSome of the verbal directions :\\n It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\nDirections seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\nIt lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\nDirections were easy to see and understand .\\n The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n You can even get

its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\nAs with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\nI like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother

one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n It worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on

directions .\\n The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\nWhat the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\nOn the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to

of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .\\n I was familiar with the streets and only used the Nuvi to get an accurate arrival time estimate .\\n but after that it is very easy and quite accurate to use .\\n The accuracy at this point is very good .\\nWhile the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n I've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .\\nI found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .\\n It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\nI updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n If your looking for a nice, accurate GPS for not so much money, got with this one .\\n0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, August 6, 2009\\n The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .\\n After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\nThe estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .\\nAccuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .\\n Accuracy is determined by the maps .\\n Less traveled rural roads will not be accurate on any unit .\\n Accuracy is within a few yards .\\nWhat the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .\\nI'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\nMy new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n Easy to use, excellent accuracy, nice and intuitive interface .\\n The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .\\n,  Very Accurate but with one small glitch I found ,  I'll explain in the CONS\\nThis is a great GPS, it is so easy to use and it is always accurate .\\nVery easy to operate and pretty accurate as well, only led me astray once and that was in northern Maine where roads are few and paved ones fewer .\\n Easy to use and amazed at how accurate this item is .\\nTo date it's been a very easy to use and accurate .\\n Mounted really easily and has been very accurate .\\n seems to be rather accurate .\\n It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\nHighly accurate, POIs are great .\\n I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .\\n Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
